# Contributing to GeneralRelativityMadness

All contributions are to be made in forks and be sent in via pull requests. Never commit directly to the main branch.

Review of contributions may take several days and may be rejected if it is found to violate these non-exhaustive set of guidelines below:
1. Contribution is incompatible with the main branch, or is not backwards compatible with recent commits.
2. Contribution results in physically unrealistic behaviour that cannot be rectified with tweaking.
3. Contribution is malicious or contains elements written in bad faith or mal-intent.
4. Contribution violates the code of conduct, or is not in the spirit of this project.
5. Contribution is too minor or trivial.

These set of guidelines may change at any time and it is under the responsibility of the contributor to verify that it meets the standards set above.

### Consequences of Repeated Infractions
A consistent pattern of violating the above general set of guidelines may result in measures taken, in increasing severity such as:
1. A private warning message, detailing the severity of the infraction and the cause, as well as recommended actions to be taken.
2. Reduced priority in accessing a contribution.
 - Repeated infractions result in lower priority in reviewing and accessing contributions.
3. A temporary ban, detailing the severity of the infraction and the cause, as well as recommended actions to be taken.
4. A permanent ban, in the case of repeated severe infractions without resolution.
