# General Relativity ~Madness~
An implementation of G.R. into unity. Use it however you like (and give me some credit :>)

  Interior geodesics in the Kerr-Schild metric, with its horizons.


And more! The only things left to be implemented are for example, solving Einstein's field equations. (However this will not be worked on as of yet).

# Note: Optimisations have not been put in place - performance issues may be present on weaker machines.
